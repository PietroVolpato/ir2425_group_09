Exploration Node
...
IMPORTANT NOTE: in the particular map given, it is easy to see that, after tiago rotatesof 360 and pass the corridor all the tags on the 
right of the beginning of the corridor have always been detected. Hence if would be good, in this case, to force a goal to be in the core room,
and never entering the corridor. However, in the general case, there is no grant that we explored the room on the other side of the corridor,
so it would be a terrible mistake to forbid the robot to reach that room again, and potentially making the task always fail.
so, by implementation choice WE DECIDED to stick to the general case: hence to allow the algoritm to generate a goal leading to the corridor 
(again) and by consequence activating the controw and goingh trowugh it. Tiago will then explore the small room at the beginning 
(even if there are never new tags), and in a small time go back through the corridor (control law) and get back to the core room.
We though that is better to don't base the algorthm on the characteristic of this particular map, when possible.
