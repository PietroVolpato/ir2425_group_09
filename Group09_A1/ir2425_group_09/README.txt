In this repository there is only the package of our solution for the task.
You need to clone also the packages tiago_iaslab_simulation and gazebo_ros_link_attacher inside your workspace.

### HOW TO RUN ###

You need two (extra) terminals, and after building and source the workspace run:

TERMINAL 1:
rosrun ir2425_group_09 nodeA.py

TERMINAL 2:
roslaunch ir2425_group_09 launcher.launch

All the prints that the user is meant to see are in the terminal 1 (NODE A).
Note that in the launch file there are also parameters for one node.
